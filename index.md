*Former management consultant and economist turned software engineer.*

My development experience is concentrated in building B2C apps using React & React Native with Redux on the front-end and Node.js & Express with various SQL and NoSQL databases (primarily MongoDB & PostgreSQL) on the back-end. Originally from Austria, I currently live in London.

Before becoming an engineer, I worked as a management consultant at [Bain & Company](https://bain.com), primarily in the technology and telecommunications team. Before that, I studied Economics at LSE and Warwick in the UK, where I gained experience as an economist during several internships in antitrust, renewable energy and the British Government Economic Service.
