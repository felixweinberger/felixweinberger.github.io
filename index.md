I'm Felix. I'm a management consultant with an interest in technology, economics and data science. Originally from Austria, I currently work at [Bain & Company](https://bain.com) in Munich.

Before joining Bain I studied Economics at LSE and Warwick in the UK. I gained experience as an economist during several internships in antitrust, energy and the British Government Economic Service.

I enjoy technical work and build projects like [rohrrechner.at](https://rohrrechner.at) (a shipping weight calculation utility for steel pipe vendors and buyers) in my spare time.
