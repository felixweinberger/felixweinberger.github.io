  <h1>Felix Weinberger</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Felix. I'm a management consultant with an interest in technology, economics and data science.
    Originally from Austria, I currently work at Bain & Company in Munich.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining Bain I studied Economics at LSE and Warwick in the UK. 
    I gained experience as an economist during several internships in antitrust, energy and the British Government Economic Service.

  <p>
    I enjoy technical work and build projects like <a href="http://rohrrechner.at">rohrrechner.at</a> 
    (a shipping weight calculation utility for steel pipe vendors and buyers) in my spare time.
